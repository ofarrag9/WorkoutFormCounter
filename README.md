# Workout Form Counter App

## Overview
Have you ever been unsure of whether you are doing a workout correctly or not. This summer, I was new to working out, and I was not sure if the form of my workouts were correct or not. That is why I created the Workout Form Counter App, which is a mobile application designed to monitor and enhance your workout sessions through real-time exercise detection and feedback. Leveraging advanced machine learning models with React Native, this app provides a seamless and interactive experience to help you maintain correct form and consistency in your exercises.

## Demo

## Features
- **Real-Time Exercise Detection**: Utilizes your device's camera to detect exercises and monitor your form.
- **Feedback System**: Offers instant feedback on your workout form and counts repetitions to ensure you're getting the most out of your workout.
- **Progress Tracking**: Keeps track of your workouts, displaying your progress over time to keep you motivated.
- **Multi-Exercise Support**: Currently supports a variety of exercises, including bicep curls and squats, with plans to expand to more exercises in future updates.
